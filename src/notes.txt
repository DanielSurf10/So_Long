• If the map contains a duplicates characters (exit/start), you should
display an error message;

• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error;

• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must
exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of
your choice;
